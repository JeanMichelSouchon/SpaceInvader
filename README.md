# Space Invader
## Overview

Space Invader is a classic arcade-style game where players control a spaceship to defend Earth from incoming waves of alien invaders. This project aims to recreate the nostalgic experience.

## What is done

- File App.js  where we can find 3 function ( initPlateau(), updateScore() and resetGame() )
- File vaisseau.js  where we can find 4 function ( lancerPartie(), effaceShip(), afficheShip() and deplacerVaisseau() )
- File missile.js where we can find 2 function ( deplacementMissile() and pewPew() )
- File alien.js where we can find 5 function ( initAlien(), parcoursGrille(), effacerAlien(), afficerAlien() and resetAlien() )
- File style.css witch contain all the style of the game

## Bug and fixes coming

- Bug in the collision between the missile and the alien
- Bug in the display ( sometimes the missile stay in the board instead of being cleared )
